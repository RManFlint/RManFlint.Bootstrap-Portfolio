<p >Hello, I'm Jim Holmberg, a double grad of University of Kansas with degrees in 
      finance (minor in econ) and law.  I worked as an analyst for the Kansas City Federal 
      Reserve Bank for two years before returning for law school.
  </p>
  <p>After law school, I took a position with Edward J. Bellen and Partners, a law firm in Frankfurt
      am Main, West Germany specializing in military law, to wit, courts-martial and administrative
      separation proceedings.  I lived there for three years and gained passable German language skills.
  </p>
  <p>Upon returning to the United States, I focused my practice on bankruptcy law and general civil
      litigation, even arguing before the Kansas Supreme Court.
